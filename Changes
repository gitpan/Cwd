Revision history for Perl extension Cwd.

2.08_03

 - Make sure the correct version of Cwd.pm is loaded in the regression
   tests. [Sam Vilain]

 - Removed some gratuitous uses of 5.6-isms like our(), with the aim
   of backporting this module to perl 5.005.

2.08_02  Thu Aug 21 11:41:27 CDT 2003

 - Removed some redundant OS/2 code at the suggestion of Michael
   Schwern and Ilya Zakharevich.

 - Simplified all code that autoloads Carp.pm and calls
   carp()/croak().

2.08_01  Tue Aug 19 12:24:04 2003

  - Code extracted from bleadperl/maintperl and packaged as a separate
    testing release by Ken Williams.  Very few significant changes, if
    any.  Not released to CPAN, but circulated among a few testers.
