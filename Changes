Revision history for Perl extension Cwd.

2.08_02  Thu Aug 21 11:41:27 CDT 2003

 - Removed some redundant OS/2 code at the suggestion of Michael
   Schwern and Ilya Zakharevich.

 - Simplified all code that autoloads Carp.pm and calls
   carp()/croak().

2.08_01  Tue Aug 19 12:24:04 2003

  - Code extracted from bleadperl/maintperl and packaged as a separate
    testing release by Ken Williams.  Very few significant changes, if
    any.  Not released to CPAN, but circulated among a few testers.
